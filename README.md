This repository contains Python code for predicting diabetes in patients using machine learning techniques. The project leverages various Python libraries such as `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

## Introduction

Diabetes is a widespread chronic disease characterized by high blood sugar levels. Early detection and management of diabetes are crucial for preventing complications and improving patient outcomes. This project aims to develop machine learning models to predict the risk of diabetes in individuals based on various health indicators and risk factors.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd diabetes-prediction
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

- Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing the code.
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook diabetes_prediction.ipynb
  # or
  python diabetes_prediction.py
  ```

- Follow the instructions in the notebook or script to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.
